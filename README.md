# About this Repo
**The way I interact with my system has never been the same after discovering [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) & [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).** In this repository I am sharing my config files of these to incredible apps. For Karabiner, since the default json file is quite complicated to setup and keep up with any changes, I am using an EDN file created for use with [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo) (another lifesaver of an app). 

If you do not have Karabiner but also are interested in getting ideas for setting up your Keyboard layers, I have included [a note](Karabiner/KARABINER%20-%20Config.md) that I keep with all my modifications in a format that may be easier to read. This may give you some ideas on what to do. Please feel free to ask for any questions.

While most users control Yabai with [SKHD](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd), I just found Karabiner more than capable for this so [my Karabiner EDN](Karabiner/karabiner.edn) file includes some layers specifically for this.

I must mention that these configuration files are not meant to simply be copied to someone else’s system. My hope is that others can use them for inspiration or to look for parts or pieces they can adapt to their own system. After all,  most of what I’ve implemented has been inspired by others and it’s a constant work in progress.
