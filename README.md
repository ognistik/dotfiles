# About this Repo
**The way I interact with my system has never been the same after discovering [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) & [Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements).** In this repository I am sharing my config files of these to incredible apps. For Karabiner, since the default json file is quite complicated to setup and keep up with any changes, I am using an EDN file created for use with [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo) (another lifesaver of an app).

While most users control Yabai with [SKHD](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd), I found Karabiner more than capable for this so [my Karabiner EDN](Karabiner/karabiner.edn) file includes some layers specifically for this.

I must mention that these configuration files are not meant to simply be copied to someone else’s system. My hope is that others can use them for inspiration or to look for parts or pieces they can adapt to their own system. After all,  most of what I’ve implemented has been inspired by others and it’s a constant work in progress.

Another thing that you will find in this repository is my collection of Keyboard Maestro macros. I am using the [Macro Repository tool by Dan Thomas](https://github.com/dagware/DanThomas/blob/master/MacroRepository/MacroRepository.md) to save these files, and if you want to import them you'll need the same utility. It's a fantastic way to both backup Keyboard Maestro macros and also have some sort of version control. Not all the macros are meant to work right away in systems other than mine. Some of them still require external scripts or files, but feel free to take a look.
